# odin-recipes

I'm building a local 'recipes' web site as part of The ODIN Project (TOP).
This is also my first use of 'markdown' so I'll learn as I go.

## Website Construction Thoughts

- Get example recipes off the web that my spouse likes

- Save the links but also download the external pages to my local machine so they can be used offline

- Add a sort option

- Add a search option

- Include pictures/images

- Include content from top-rated recipes sites
