# odin-recipes

For building a local 'recipes' web site as part of TOP.
This is also my first use of 'markdown' so I'll learn as I go.

## Website Construction Thoughts

- Get example recipes off the web that PKM likes

- Save the links but also download the external pages to the local machine so it can be used offline

- Add a sort option

- Add a search option

- Include pictures/images

- Cover the top rated recipes sites
